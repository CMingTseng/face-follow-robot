# ESP32-CAM and Elegoo Tumbller face following robot

The code for a face tracking robot that follow a persons face. Uses the ESP-FACE libraries detect a face and measure distance and location of the face.

The esp32-wifi-version.ino sketch has extra code which enables viewing of the camera feed in a browser, including the green box around the face. This extra code reduces the frame rate and therefore the fluidity of the face capture. The robot is more responsive when the  esp32-fast-version.ino  sketch is used.
